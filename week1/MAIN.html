				<p>A new breed of grandeur.
				   The new BMW X5 design makes a powerful statement. 
				   The enlarged one-piece kidney grille, which has a hexagonal design, is paired with a sculptured bonnet, and gives the iconic front a new lease of life. Other standout features include the short overhang, a compact wheelbase, and a noticeably more upright appearance. And when combined with the elegant roofline,
				   itâ€™s grandeur and sportiness is in perfect harmony.</p>
